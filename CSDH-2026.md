## Abstract

The field of data physicalisation “examines how computer-supported, physical representations of data (i.e., physicalisations), can support cognition, communication, learning, problem solving, and decision making.” (Jansen et al. 2015, 8) The translation of data into a tangible output carries many potentialities and challenges, some of which I explored in my research-creation practice. _Soft data celebration_ (2025) is a data physicalisation created from data published by the [Montreal Contemporary Art Museum](https://macm.org/) (MAC) about its collection. Plushy pompoms celebrate the origins associated with the artists of each artwork. The scale from pastels to bright and scintillating colors provides a generally soothing environment while accentuating less common occurrences. The pompoms are assembled into garlands representing yearly acquisitions by the museum and dangle from a circular mobile hung atop a fluffy carpet. In this proposal, I would like to share the experience of making, sharing and documenting *Soft data celebration*, a case study in my research on GLAM+ data physicalisation.

I will begin by recounting the makings of the project. In the open data about the artists in the museum's collection, I wanted to work critically with the “nationality” property. I decided to loosen the nationalistic constraint to recognise both indigenous and québecois identities. While it is common for many individuals to have multiple origins, their representation is often treated as a visualisation “issue”. The material approach, translating visualisation into physicalisation, provided space to add as many pompoms as necessary to embrace the artists' diversity. Providing a tactile entry point also enabled broader access both to the data and to the MAC collection. How does experiencing soft and plushy data affect our perception of it? In this tangible environment, change is a simple repair made by cutting the thread and tying new knots. Serendipity also enriched the project: the garlands of feather-light pompoms bent the PEX structure of the mobile, forming an unexpectedly “physical data-driven” Bézier curve.

*Soft Data Celebration* is a case study in my doctoral research at the crossroads of textility and algorithmics. My approach is founded in thinking of craft as technology and of technology as craft in order to highlight the fabrication process of digital work as well as the technicity of hand crafted artifacts. Having a practice-based research (_une pratique de recherche-création_) means that the steps of sharing and documenting the work are as important as the creative process of making. I will therefore recount two demos of the project (2025, 2026) as well as the joys and challenges I have been experiencing in creating documentation for this project. Participatory photographic documentation, sensory audiodescription, open-source code, and zine production: these endeavors archive the different narratives and experiences that the installation embraces. They also allow creation to weave its way back into academic research, contributing to the many shapes of this data-driven project.
